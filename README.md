# hello-world
Officially beginning my GitHub!
My name is Gina, and I'm a sophomore in the Human Centered Design & Engineering Bachelor's program at UW. I'm planning to pair HCDE with a degree in Anthropology as well, both because it's personally interesting and because I think an understanding of social science informs the HCD approach in a meaningful way.
